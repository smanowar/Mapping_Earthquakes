# Mapping Earthquakes Using Leaflet and JavaScript

Using Leaflet and JavaScript we have created an interactive map that displays GeoJSON data of earthquakes that have occoured within the past 7 days. 

The magnitude of the earthquake is displayed by the size of the circle on the location the earthquake occoured. Click on a circle to get information regarding the magnitude of the earthquake and the location where it happened.

Play around with the toggles to view:
- Tectonic plate lines
- All earthquakes that have occoured within the past 7 days
- Major earthquakes (magnitude > 4.5) that have occoured within the past 7 days

There are also 3 modes for viewing:
- Light Mode
- Dark Mode
- Satellite View
